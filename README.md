# Dense Neural Network Implementation in Java (easy to use)
This project is a TensorFlow-like ML tool that lets you use deep learning in Java.
Using this implementation of a neural network in Java, you can create neural networks as deep and wide as you want with ease.

(Examples of how to use it coming up)
